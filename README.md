# Voice-Gender-Classification-Using-Machine-Learning
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to classify voice recordings based on gender. The dataset used for this project contains various acoustic properties of voice recordings, labeled as either 'male' or 'female'. The goal is to build an accurate model that can predict the gender of a speaker from their voice characteristics.
